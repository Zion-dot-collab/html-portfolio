<h1> About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with a passion for building responsive, user-centered web applications from start to finish. I enjoy turning ideas into real, working products using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Whether it's creating a clean and accessible front-end interface or designing efficient, secure back-end systems, I love solving problems and continuously improving my skills. I'm comfortable working independently or collaborating in a team environment using Git and Agile workflows.</p>
<p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, contributing to small projects, and learning ways to make the web faster and more inclusive.</p>
